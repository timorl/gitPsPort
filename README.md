The git prompt for fish
=======================

This is actually already implemented in fish natively under the name
`__fish_git_prompt`. When I set out to make this port I was not aware of it,
as googling `fish __git_ps1` returned the attempts mentioned below.
If you got here on a similar path you probably want to use the builtin version.
Seriously, it has more features and is way better written.

This is a port of the `__git_ps1` command for bash/zsh that is part of git.
The work was inspired by earlier attempts at making such a port, the
latest of which can be found
[here](https://gist.github.com/nh2/1e7e05a2b9f2ea229f23).
